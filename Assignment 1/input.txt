If we are going to say that a given program thinks like a human, we must have some way of
determining how humans think. We need to get inside the actual workings of human minds.
There are three ways to do this: through introspection—trying to catch our own thoughts as
they go by; through psychological experiments—observing a person in action; and through
brain imaging—observing the brain in action. Once we have a sufficiently precise theory of
the mind, it becomes possible to express the theory as a computer program. If the program’s
input–output behavior matches corresponding human behavior, that is evidence that some of
the program’s mechanisms could also be operating in humans. For example, Allen Newell
and Herbert Simon, who developed GPS, the “General Problem Solver” (Newell and Simon,
1961), were not content merely to have their program solve problems correctly. They were
more concerned with comparing the trace of its reasoning steps to traces of human subjects
COGNITIVE SCIENCE solving the same problems. The interdisciplinary field of cognitive science brings together
computer models from AI and experimental techniques from psychology to construct precise
and testable theories of the human mind.
Cognitive science is a fascinating field in itself, worthy of several textbooks and at least
one encyclopedia (Wilson and Keil, 1999). We will occasionally comment on similarities or
differences between AI techniques and human cognition. Real cognitive science, however, is
necessarily based on experimental investigation of actual humans or animals. We will leave
that for other books, as we assume the reader has only a computer for experimentation.
In the early days of AI there was often confusion between the approaches: an author
would argue that an algorithm performs well on a task and that it is therefore a good model
of human performance, or vice versa. Modern authors separate the two kinds of claims;
this distinction has allowed both AI and cognitive science to develop more rapidly. The two
fields continue to fertilize each other, most notably in computer vision, which incorporates
neurophysiological evidence into computational models.
